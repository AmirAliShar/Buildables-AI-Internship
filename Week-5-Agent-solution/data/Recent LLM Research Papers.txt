â€¢ "Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models" by Jason Wei, Yi Tay, et al.
This paper explores how chain-of-thought prompting improves complex reasoning in LLMs. The researchers demonstrate that step-by-step reasoning traces significantly enhance performance on mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks across multiple model sizes.
Key Contribution: Systematic analysis of chain-of-thought benefits and scaling laws for reasoning capabilities.

â€¢ "Efficient Fine-Tuning of Transformer Models" by Sarah Chen, Michael Johnson
The study introduces a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that reduces computational costs by 70% while maintaining 95% of full fine-tuning performance. Method combines adapter layers with low-rank adaptation techniques.
Key Contribution: Novel fine-tuning approach that dramatically reduces resource requirements for model adaptation.
