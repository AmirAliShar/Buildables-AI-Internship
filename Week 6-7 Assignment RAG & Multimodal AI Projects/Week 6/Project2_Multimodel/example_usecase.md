ðŸ§© Use Case Description

This project is a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed to analyze and understand complex PDF documents containing text, charts, tables, and figures.

The system extracts structured information from different content types using advanced document parsing, then creates embeddings with the Gemini model and stores them in Chroma for efficient retrieval.

When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks â€” whether they come from textual paragraphs, numerical tables, or visual chart descriptions â€” and generates a context-aware, accurate answer using the Gemini language model.

This solution can handle long-context documents (50,000+ tokens) and supports multi-part queries, making it highly useful for:

Research paper and technical report summarization

Data and chart interpretation from documents

Business or financial report analysis

Educational tools for complex PDF learning materials

It demonstrates how Gemini models, LangChain, and Chroma can be integrated to create a multimodal, long-context intelligent document assistant.
