|\\n|----------|----------------|----------------------|\\n| **Size** | Mini‑grid, Microgrid, Large‑scale | Load size, complexity, regulatory thresholds |\\n| **Source** | Renewable‑centric, Dispatchable‑centric, Hybrid | Availability of local resources, cost of fuel |\\n| **Mode** | Grid‑connected, Islandable, Hybrid | Reliability requirements, grid support |\\n| **Control** | Hierarchical, Distributed, Autonomous | System complexity, operator expertise |\\n| **Topology** | Radial, Meshed | Redundancy needs, cost of cabling |\\n| **Sector** | Residential, Commercial,

compliance |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Use These Categories\\n\\n1. **Design & Planning** – Start with the *size* and *sector* to determine the baseline system scope.  \\n2. **Resource Assessment** – Choose the *source mix* that fits local resource availability and cost.  \\n3. **Control Strategy** – Pick *control architecture* that matches the complexity you can manage (or outsource).  \\n4. **Connectivity Decision** – Decide on *mode* based on reliability needs and grid‑code requirements.  \\n5. **Topology** – Design the network layout that balances reliability and cost.  \\n6. **Business Case** – Align *purpose* and *market* participation to unlock incentives or revenue streams.  \\n7. **Governance** – Clarify ownership and operation models early to secure funding and regulatory approvals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Common Misconceptions\\n\\n| Misconception | Reality |\\n|---------------|---------|\\n| “Microgrid = off‑grid” | Many microgrids are grid‑connected and only island when needed. |\\n| “All microgrids are renewable” | Dispatchable generators (diesel, gas) are common, especially in remote or reliability‑critical sites. |\\n| “Microgrid control is always centralized” | Distributed and autonomous control is increasingly common, especially for small or community projects. |\\n| “Size is the only important dimension” | Size matters, but the *source mix*, *mode*, and *purpose* can be equally critical. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quick Glossary\\n\\n- **Mini‑grid** – <\\u202f100\\u202fkW, usually a single building or small cluster.  \\n- **Microgrid** – 100\\u202fkW\\u202f–\\u202f10\\u202fMW, can serve a campus or small town.  \\n- **Macrogrid** – >\\u202f10\\u202fMW, often part of a larger regional system.  \\n- **Islandable** – System can disconnect and maintain local power.  \\n- **Droop control** – Primary control that adjusts power output based on frequency/voltage.  \\n- **Ancillary services** – Frequency regulation, voltage support, spinning reserve.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Take‑away\\n\\nMicrogrids are not a single, one‑size‑fits‑all technology.  \\nThey are a **family** of systems that can be classified along multiple axes:\\n\\n1. **Size** (mini‑grid, microgrid, large‑scale)  \\n2. **Source mix** (renewable, dispatchable, storage)  \\n3. **Connectivity** (grid‑connected, islandable, hybrid)  \\n4. **Control**

Also, when such things as cyber-attacks or \\neven natural disasters are less likely to occur, microgrids can improve \\ngrid resilience through localized control and flexibility [ 5 ].

I decided to use supervised learning as an\\nexample because it’s the type of machine learning most frequently used in practice.\\nThe supervised learning process starts with gathering the data. The data for supervised\\nlearning is a collection of pairs (input, output). Input could be anything, for example, email\\nmessages, pictures, or sensor measurements. Outputs are usually real numbers, or labels (e.g.\\n“spam”, “not_spam”, “cat”, “dog”, “mouse”, etc). In some cases, outputs are vectors (e.g.,\\nfour coordinates of the rectangle around a person on the picture), sequences (e.g. [“adjective”,\\n“adjective”, “noun”] for the input “big beautiful car”), or have some other structure.\\nLet’s say the problem that you want to solve using supervised learning is spam detection.\\nYou gather the data, for example, 10,000 email messages, each with a label either “spam” or\\n“not_spam” (you could add those labels manually or pay someone to do that for us). Now,\\nyou have to convert each email message into a feature vector.\\nThe data analyst decides, based on their experience, how to convert a real-world entity, such\\nas an email message, into a feature vector. One common way to convert a text into a feature\\nvector, calledbag of words, is to take a dictionary of English words (let’s say it contains\\n20,000 alphabetically sorted words) and stipulate that in our feature vector:\\n• the ﬁrst feature is equal to1 if the email message contains the word “a”; otherwise,\\nthis feature is0;\\n• the second feature is equal to1 if the email message contains the word “aaron”; otherwise,\\nthis feature equals0;\\n• ...\\n• the feature at position 20,000 is equal to1 if the email message contains the word\\n“zulu”; otherwise, this feature is equal to0.\\nYou repeat the above procedure for every email message in our collection, which gives'),\n",

For all\\nexamples in the dataset, the feature at positionj in the feature vector always contains the\\nsame kind of information.

The Training Cycle\\n\\n1. **Feed Input → Model**  \\n   The model receives a feature vector (e.g., an image).\\n\\n2. **Predict Output**  \\n   The model produces a prediction (e.g., probability that the image is a cat).\\n\\n3. **Compute Loss**  \\n   Compare prediction to the true label (e.g., using cross‑entropy).\\n\\n4. **Back‑propagate Error**  \\n   Compute gradients of loss w.r.t. model parameters.\\n\\n5. **Update Parameters**  \\n   Adjust weights using an optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam).\\n\\n6. **Repeat**  \\n   Iterate over many epochs until loss converges or validation performance stops improving.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Types of Supervised Tasks\\n\\n| Task | Typical Problem | Common Algorithms |\\n|------|-----------------|-------------------|\\n| **Regression** | Predict a continuous value | Linear regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural networks |\\n| **Classification** | Assign a discrete class | Logistic regression, SVM, Decision trees, CNNs (image), RNNs (text) |\\n| **Multilabel** | Predict multiple independent labels | Multi‑output classifiers, Sigmoid + cross‑entropy |\\n| **Structured Prediction** | Predict structured outputs (sequences, trees) | CRFs, Seq2Seq models |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4.
