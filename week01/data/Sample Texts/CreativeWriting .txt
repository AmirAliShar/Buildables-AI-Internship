The old lighthouse stood sentinel, its beam a lonely sentinel against the encroaching fog. Inside, Elias polished the lens, the familiar scent of brine and oil a comfort. His grandfather had built this lighthouse, his father had tended it, and Elias knew he would be the last. The sea, once a vibrant tapestry of life, now whispered only of the fading fishing industry and the lonely life that was its legacy. He watched a lone gull, its cry a mournful echo against the dull rumble of distant waves, and wondered if the world had forgotten the quiet heroism of these shores. A ship's horn moaned through the mist, a reminder of the unseen world beyond his isolated post. He paused, the polishing rag still in his hand, and for a moment, felt the weight of the world's indifference settle upon him, heavy as the fog itself. He sighed, then resumed his work, the slow, steady rhythm a defiance against the encroaching twilight and the fading light of his life's purpose.
