6. Observations & Insights

Zero-Shot: Best for quick, simple tasks (translation, classification). Weak in reasoning-heavy puzzles.

Few-Shot: Improved consistency and step-by-step answers in math and reasoning tasks.

CoT: Gave the best reasoning clarity (especially for puzzles & summarization). Sometimes verbose but most logical.

6. Reflection Questions

Q1. Which method gave the most accurate results?  
âž¡ Few-Shot and CoT both outperformed Zero-Shot. CoT was best for reasoning-heavy tasks, Few-Shot for structured answers.

Q2. Did the CoT prompts improve reasoning quality?  
âž¡ Yes âœ… CoT significantly improved reasoning by forcing the model to explain step-by-step, especially in logic puzzles and math.


Q3. How much do examples influence the modelâ€™s responses?  
âž¡ Examples had a big influence: Few-Shot made the model more consistent and avoided shortcuts. It helped in tasks like summarization where Zero-Shot was too brief.
